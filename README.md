### About this project
This project using NEAT (**NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies**) to build and train an AI to play a simple game (Pong). I implemeneted all the interface of the game and the algorithms to play the game. The AI building and training is supported by YouTuber 'Tech With Tim'.
